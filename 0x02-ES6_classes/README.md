# ES6 classes
ES6 classes are a way of defining and creating objects in JavaScript that follows the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm. 
ES6 classes are syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance model in JavaScript. 
They provide a more familiar and intuitive syntax for creating and working with objects in a class-based manner.
ES6 classes also support inheritance, which allows for creating a hierarchy of classes with shared functionality.
