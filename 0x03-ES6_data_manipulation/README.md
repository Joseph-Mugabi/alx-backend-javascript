## ES6_data_manipulation
```
ES6 introduced several new features for data manipulation, including:

* Array methods: ES6 introduced several new methods to manipulate arrays, including map(),
filter(), reduce(), find(), findIndex(), and forEach(). These methods make it easier to perform
operations on arrays, such as transforming each element of an array, filtering out unwanted elements, or summing up the values of an array.

* Spread operator: The spread operator (...) can be used to expand an array into individual elements, or to concatenate multiple arrays into a single array.

* Destructuring: Destructuring allows you to extract values from objects and arrays and assign them to variables
in a concise and readable way. For example, const {name, age} = person would assign the name and age properties of the person object to
the variables name and age, respectively.

* Template literals: Template literals allow you to interpolate variables and expressions into strings using backticks (``).
For example, const message = Hello, ${name}!; would create a string with the value Hello, ${name}!, where name is the value of the name variable.

* Object methods: ES6 introduced several new methods to manipulate objects, 
including Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries(). These methods make it easier to work with the keys and values of objects.

* Set and Map: ES6 introduced two new data structures, Set and Map, that allow you to store unique values and key-value pairs,
respectively. These data structures have methods for adding, removing, and querying their contents.
