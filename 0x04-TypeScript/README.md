TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
It is a statically typed superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid
JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript extends JavaScript 
by adding static typing, classes, interfaces, and other features to help developers
write more robust and maintainable code.

Features and Concepts in TypeScript:
1. classes and objects.
2. Static Typing.
3. Modules and Namespaces.
4. Type Inference.
5. Generic and 
6. Tooling and Language service.

TypeScript helps developers catch errors early, write more maintainable code, and leverage the benefits of modern JavaScript while
providing additional features and tooling support.
